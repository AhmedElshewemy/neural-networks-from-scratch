In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique\\ncalled Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling\\nin speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The\\nexperimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms\\nof transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and\\nenvironments.\\n\",\n          \"  A susceptibility propagation that is constructed by combining a belief\\npropagation and a linear response method is used for approximate computation\\nfor Markov random fields. Herein, we formulate a new, improved susceptibility\\npropagation by using the concept of a diagonal matching method that is based on\\nmean-field approaches to inverse Ising problems. The proposed susceptibility\\npropagation is robust for various network structures, and it is reduced to the\\nordinary susceptibility propagation and to the adaptive\\nThouless-Anderson-Palmer equation in special cases.\\n\",\n          \"  We propose a new model for formalizing reward collection problems on graphs\\nwith dynamically generated rewards which may appear and disappear based on a\\nstochastic model. The *robot routing problem* is modeled as a graph whose nodes\\nare stochastic processes generating potential rewards over discrete time. The\\nrewards are generated according to the stochastic process, but at each step, an\\nexisting reward disappears with a given probability. The edges in the graph\\nencode the (unit-distance) paths between the rewards' locations. On visiting a\\nnode, the robot collects the accumulated reward at the node at that time, but\\ntraveling between the nodes takes time. The optimization question asks to\\ncompute an optimal (or epsilon-optimal) path that maximizes the expected\\ncollected rewards.\\nWe consider the finite and infinite-horizon robot routing problems. For\\nfinite-horizon, the goal is to maximize the total expected reward, while for\\ninfinite horizon we consider limit-average objectives. We study the\\ncomputational and strategy complexity of these problems, establish NP-lower\\nbounds and show that optimal strategies require memory in general. We also\\nprovide an algorithm for computing epsilon-optimal infinite paths for arbitrary\\nepsilon > 0.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n
