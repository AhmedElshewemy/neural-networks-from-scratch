In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique\\ncalled Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling\\nin speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The\\nexperimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms\\nof transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and\\nenvironments.\\n\",\n          \"  A susceptibility propagation that is constructed by combining a belief\\npropagation and a linear response method is used for approximate computation\\nfor Markov random fields. Herein, we formulate a new, improved susceptibility\\npropagation by using the concept of a diagonal matching method that is based on\\nmean-field approaches to inverse Ising problems. The proposed susceptibility\\npropagation is robust for various network structures, and it is reduced to the\\nordinary susceptibility propagation and to the adaptive\\nThouless-Anderson-Palmer equation in special cases.\\n\",\n          \"  We propose a new model for formalizing reward collection problems on graphs\\nwith dynamically generated rewards which may appear and disappear based on a\\nstochastic model. The *robot routing problem* is modeled as a graph whose nodes\\nare stochastic processes generating potential rewards over discrete time. The\\nrewards are generated according to the stochastic process, but at each step, an\\nexisting reward disappears with a given probability. The edges in the graph\\nencode the (unit-distance) paths between the rewards' locations. On visiting a\\nnode, the robot collects the accumulated reward at the node at that time, but\\ntraveling between the nodes takes time. The optimization question asks to\\ncompute an optimal (or epsilon-optimal) path that maximizes the expected\\ncollected rewards.\\nWe consider the finite and infinite-horizon robot routing problems. For\\nfinite-horizon, the goal is to maximize the total expected reward, while for\\ninfinite horizon we consider limit-average objectives. We study the\\ncomputational and strategy complexity of these problems, establish NP-lower\\nbounds and show that optimal strategies require memory in general.

In particular, we propose the use of\\n$k$-determinantal point processes in hyperparameter optimization via random\\nsearch. Compared to conventional uniform random search where hyperparameter\\nsettings are sampled independently, a $k$-DPP promotes diversity. We describe\\nan approach that transforms hyperparameter search spaces for efficient use with\\na $k$-DPP. In addition, we introduce a novel Metropolis-Hastings algorithm\\nwhich can sample from $k$-DPPs defined over any space from which uniform\\nsamples can be drawn, including spaces with a mixture of discrete and\\ncontinuous dimensions or tree structure. Our experiments show significant\\nbenefits in realistic scenarios with a limited budget for training supervised\\nlearners, whether in serial or parallel.\\n\",\n          \"  Denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful deep learning models used for\\nfeature extraction, data generation and network pre-training. DAEs consist of\\nan encoder and decoder which may be trained simultaneously to minimise a loss\\n(function) between an input and the reconstruction of a corrupted version of\\nthe input. There are two common loss functions used for training autoencoders,\\nthese include the mean-squared error (MSE) and the binary cross-entropy (BCE).\\nWhen training autoencoders on image data a natural choice of loss function is\\nBCE, since pixel values may be normalised to take values in [0,1] and the\\ndecoder model may be designed to generate samples that take values in (0,1). We\\nshow theoretically that DAEs trained to minimise BCE may be used to take\\ngradient steps in the data space towards regions of high probability under the\\ndata-generating distribution. Previously this had only been shown for DAEs\\ntrained using MSE. As a consequence of the theory, iterative application of a\\ntrained DAE moves a data sample from regions of low probability to regions of\\nhigher probability under the data-generating distribution. Firstly, we validate\\nthe theory by showing that novel data samples, consistent with the training\\ndata, may be synthesised when the initial data samples are random noise.\\nSecondly, we motivate the theory by showing that initial data samples\\nsynthesised via other methods may be improved via iterative application of a\\ntrained DAE to those initial samples.\\n\",\n          \"  Designing an e-commerce recommender system that serves hundreds of millions\\nof active users is a daunting challenge. From a human vision perspective,\\nthere're two key factors that affect users' behaviors: items' attractiveness\\nand their matching degree with users' interests. This paper proposes Telepath,\\na vision-based bionic recommender system model, which understands users from\\nsuch perspective. Telepath is a combination of a convolutional neural network\\n(CNN), a recurrent neural network (RNN) and deep neural networks (DNNs). Its\\nCNN subnetwork simulates the human vision system to extract key visual signals\\nof items' attractiveness and generate corresponding activations. Its RNN and\\nDNN subnetworks simulate cerebral cortex to understand users' interest based on\\nthe activations generated from browsed items. In practice, the Telepath model\\nhas been launched to JD's recommender system and advertising system. For one of\\nthe major item recommendation blocks on the JD app, click-through rate (CTR),\\ngross merchandise value (GMV) and orders have increased 1.59%, 8.16% and 8.71%\\nrespectively.
